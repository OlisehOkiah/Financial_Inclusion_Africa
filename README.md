## Insights
1. **Age & Financial Inclusion:** Younger populations in East Africa exhibit varied financial inclusion rates, with transitions occurring around formal employment entry age.
2. **Urban vs Rural Divide:** Financial inclusion is higher in urban regions than rural ones due to the availability of financial services.
3. **Gender Gap:** There is a significant gender disparity in financial inclusion rates across Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Women have lower bank account ownership rates, often due to systemic financial barriers.

---

## Recommendations
Based on the findings from this analysis, the following actions are recommended:
1. **Target Financial Literacy for Women:** Financial education programs should specifically address barriers faced by women in financial systems.
2. **Increase Banking Access in Rural Areas:** Focus on expanding banking services and infrastructure in rural regions to reduce urban-rural divides.
3. **Age-Specific Financial Services:** Create age-targeted financial programs for youth transitioning into formal economies.
4. **Collaborate with Mobile Banking Providers:** Leverage mobile technology to ensure access to financial inclusion for hard-to-reach populations.
